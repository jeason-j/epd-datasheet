## Note

### CSn

This pin (`CS#`) is the chip select input connecting to the MCU.
<br>The chip is enabled for MCU communication only when `CS#` is pulled _LOW_.

### D/Cn

| `D/C#` | Think of the data as |
| ------ | -------------------- |
| _LOW_  | Command              |
| _HIGH_ | Data                 |

### RESn

This pin (`RES#`) is reset signal input.
<br>The Reset is active _LOW_.

### BUSY

This pin (`BUSY`) is Busy state output pin.
<br>When Busy is _HIGH_, the operation of chip should not be interrupted and any commands should not be issued to the module.
<br>The driver IC will put Busy pin _HIGH_ when the driver IC is working such as:

- Outputting display waveform
- Programming with OTP
- Communicating with digital temperature sensor

### Panel break detection

The panel break detection function is used to detect the breakage at panel edge.
<br>When the panel break detection command is issued, the panel break detection will be executed.
<br>During the detection period, `BUSY` output is at _HIGH_ level.
<br>`BUSY` output is at _LOW_ level when the detection is completed.
<br>Then, user can issue the Status Bit Read command to check the status bit for the result of panel break.

### `BS1`

| SPI Mode | `BS1`              | `RES#`   | `CS#`    | `D/C#`           |
| -------: | ------------------ | -------- | -------- | ---------------- |
|   4-wire | Connect to `VSS`   | Required | Required | Required         |
|   3-wire | Connect to `VDDIO` | Required | Required | Connect to `VSS` |

\* 3-wire: 9 bits SPI, first bit is `D/C#`

### `RESE`

While shorting `RESE` and resistor, this model is suitable for the following E-Paper displays:

| Screen |     Resistor | Model                   |
| -----: | -----------: | ----------------------- |
|  1.54" | 0.47 &Omega; | GDEW0154T8              |
|  1.54" | 3.00 &Omega; | GDEP015OC1, GDEW0154Z04 |
|  2.04" | 0.47 &Omega; | GDEW0213Z16             |
|  2.04" | 3.00 &Omega; | GDE021A1                |
|  2.13" | 0.47 &Omega; | GDEW027W3, GDEW027C44   |
|  2.13" | 3.00 &Omega; | GDEW0213B1              |
|  2.90" | 0.47 &Omega; | GDEW029T5, GDEW029Z10   |
|  2.90" | 3.00 &Omega; | GDEH029A1               |
|  7.50" | 0.47 &Omega; | GDEW042T2, GDEW042Z15   |
|  7.50" | 3.00 &Omega; | GDEW075T8, GDEW075Z09   |

### SPI

3-wire SPI caveats:
<br>The operation is similar to 4-wire SPI while `D/C#` pin is not used and it must be tied to _LOW_.
<br>In the write operation, a 9-bit data will be shifted into the shift register on every clock rising edge.
<br>The bit shifting sequence is `D/C#` bit, `D7` bit, `D6` bit to `D0` bit.
<br>The first bit is `D/C#` bit which determines the following byte is **command** or **data**.
<br>When `D/C#` bit is **0**, the following byte is **command**.
<br>When `D/C#` bit is **1**, the following byte is **data**.

| SPI Mode | Function      | D0 (`SCLK`) PIN | D1 (`MOSI`) PIN | `D/C#` PIN | `CS#` PIN |
| -------: | ------------- | :-------------: | --------------: | ---------- | --------- |
|   4-wire | Write Command |     &#8593;     |     Command bit | _LOW_      | _LOW_     |
|   4-wire | Write Data    |     &#8593;     |        Data bit | _HIGH_     | _LOW_     |
|   3-wire | Write Command |     &#8593;     |     Command bit | Tie _LOW_  | _LOW_     |
|   3-wire | Write Data    |     &#8593;     |        Data bit | Tie _LOW_  | _LOW_     |

- _LOW_ is connected to V<sub>SS</sub> and _HIGH_ is connected to V<sub>DD</sub>IO
- &#8593; stands for rising edge of signal
- `MOSI` is shifted into an 8-bit shift register on every rising edge of `SCLK` in the order of `D7`, `D6`, ... `D0`.
  <br>The level of `D/C#` should be kept over the whole byte.
  <br>The data byte in the shift register is written to the Graphic Display Data RAM (RAM)
  <br>or Data Byte register or command Byte register according to `D/C#` pin.
