## Caveats

> These panels are directly pincompatible with the 4.2" panels from Waveshare and/or Dalian Good Display beside the fact,
> that the FFC connector is "pad-down" rather than "pad-up" found on Waveshare panels and adapters.
> To connect this panel to the Waveshare HAT, i reflowed the FFC connector to make it fit.
